*This is an iOS app created as a project for the Stanford class CS193P - Developing for iOS. The app is called Set Card Game*

## App Description
Set Card Game is a digital version of the popular card game Set. The goal of the game is to identify sets of three cards from a larger set of cards. Each card has four features: shape (oval, squiggle, or diamond), color (red, green, or purple), shading (solid, striped, or open), and number (one, two, or three). A set consists of three cards that are either all the same or all different in each feature.

## Usage
To play the game, simply tap on any three cards that form a set. If the cards form a valid set, they will be removed from the board and you will earn points.
